"I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free." - Michelangelo

I heard this quote tonight and immediately embraced it. Whether it's self, sports, business, love, or life -- there's such a beautiful art to understanding our potential and then having to unearth it from our insecurities and self-imposed limitations.

One my top strengths (according to StrengthFinders) is Futuristic. Each day, week, and month is like a new block of marble for me. I rarely know how to start carving, but I know what the end result will look like. I figure out what I don't know, and I go.
